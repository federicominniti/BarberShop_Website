# BarberShop_Website
In the Barbershop website there are 3 cathegorics of users:
- Customer;
- Barbers; 
- Admin (that is also a barber).

Customers can book a new appointment specifing date, barber, hour (dependent on the others appointments of the chosed barber) and service. A customer can also delete an appointment.

Barber can accept/reject appointments, send to the admin a request of an holidays period.

Admin can do all operation of a common barber but also create new barber's account, disable barber's/user's accounts, accept/reject requests of barbers' holidays.

All users can also modify their credentials.
